<h1>Policy Surrender Risk Prediction and Identifying Surrender Trigger Factors</h1>

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a complex metric that represents the value of a customer to a company as the difference between the revenue gained and expenses incurred â€“ all projected onto the entire relationship with a customer, including the future. 
Here we suggest Machine learning and statistical analysis to predict the risk that a policyholder would surrender their Insurance Policy. 
Predicting early surrenders can help businesses better customise their policies to better suit their present policyholders as well as make suitable business decisions when providing an insurance policy to a new policyholder by analysing their data and and the policy features. 
Identifying important features can help the Insurer to focus on building their policies more suitable for the policyholders and in term, the company.
